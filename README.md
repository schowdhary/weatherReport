Used Angular-seed Project
Angular JS 1.4.0

### Install Dependencies
* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

npm install

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the angular framework files


### Run the Application
Start Server : 

npm start
Now browse to the app at http://localhost:8000/app/index.html
